| Building Arx Fatalis Fixed |
 ----------------------------

Requirements:
 - VS2010
 - DirectX SDK August 2006 (http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=c72d9f1e-53f3-4747-8490-6801d8e8b4ef)

Note: more recent DirectX SDKs won't work (you can have more than one installed though)


Steps:
1) Choose one of the following methods:
   a] copy your SDK folders Include/ and Lib/x86/ to the Sources/DX/Include and
      Sources/DX/Lib/x86 directory
   b] symlink Sources/DX/ to your DirectX SDK directory
   c] make sure VS2010 can find your DirectX SDK files
2) Open Sources/Gaia.sln
3) Build whole solution
4) Obtain fresh binaries from game/ folder
5) Profit

Note: On my computer (win7) after installing DX SDK I got compiler errors in one of the
windows headers. I've been able to fix it by removing/renaming the file Include/rpcsal.h
from DirectX SDK.
