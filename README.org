* Introduction

  This is the beginning of a port of the game Arx Fatalis to Linux.
  It is not yet usable and does not yet compile.  

* Plan

  Once the Windows-specific functions are ported (/e.g./ changing
  functions like =CreateDirectory= to =mkdir=), the plan is to then
  port the DirectX functions to SDL.

  In cases like this, the developers usually do not release the game
  data for free, so I am hoping to get the game demo working first,
  and then get the real game data.

  Things are in a very early form right now, so these plans will
  probably change very quickly.
  
* Help

  Anyone is encouraged to help.  Much of the early work in porting is
  fairly simple.  Just find a compile-error and fix it.  Then commit
  that and send a pull request.
